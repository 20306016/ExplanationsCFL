    Computes the Wasserstein distance between two discrete probability distributions over facilities.

    Formulates and solves a linear program to find the optimal transport plan `pi` minimizing the cost
    of moving distribution Prob1 to Prob2, where the cost is given by distances between locations.

        instance (dict): Dictionary containing the instance data, including:

        Prob2 (dict): Second discrete probability distribution over locations, same format as Prob1.
        distF (str): Distance function type to use in the objective. Options:
                     - "euclidean": Use squared Euclidean distances between locations.
                     - "constant": Use constant cost 1 for any transport.

    Returns:

            - float: The optimal value of the Wasserstein distance.
            - dict: Optimal transport plan variables `pi`, indexed by (n, c, c_prime).

    Notes:
        - The transport plan `pi[n, c, c_prime]` satisfies marginal constraints matching Prob1 and Prob2.
